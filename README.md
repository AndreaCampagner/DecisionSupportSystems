# Decision Support Systems
 This is the GitHub for the Theory module of the Decision Support Systems course, offered at the 1st year of the Master
 of Science in Artificial Intelligence at University of Milano-Bicocca.

 The aim of the course is to provide an intensive, theoretically-oriented introduction to normative decision theory (incl. single-agent decision theory,
 non-cooperative game theory, coalitional game theory and social choice theory), as well as applications in modern Artificial Intelligence
 (specifically, Machine Learning). The course adopts a modern teaching approach, wherein traditional "basic" content is tightly integrated
 with research-oriented lessons inspired by current developments in the field.

 Exam mode: Written exam + Oral exam (optional)
 The written exam will be an open question assessment on the core contents taught in lesson. Questions will regard either basic definitions and notions
 or hybrid exercise/theoretical questions.
 Oral examination consists of preparation and discussion of an in-depth presentation on the contents of a selected paper (either among those proposed by
 the lecturer or also proposed by the student, after agreement with the lecturer) related to the topics of the course.

 Instructor Name: Andrea Campagner (PhD)
 Instructor Affiliation: Post-Doc Researcher at IRCCS Istituto Ortopedico Galeazzi, Milan, Italy
